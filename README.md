3D Animation & Visualization
📌 What is 3D Animation/Visualization?

3D Animation and Visualization is the process of creating and interacting with three-dimensional digital content in real-time. Instead of just looking at static images, users can rotate, zoom, and explore 3D objects or entire environments from different angles.

This is widely used in:

🚗 Car customizes (rotate, change colors, preview)

🏢 Architecture walkthroughs

🛒 E-commerce product previews

⚙️ Core Features

Orbit Controls → Rotate, pan, and zoom around objects

Lighting & Materials → Realistic shading (matte, metallic, glossy)

Animations → Move objects, open doors, or animate characters

🚀 Why it’s Important

3D visualization helps users:

Understand designs better before production

Experience products in a realistic way online

Engage with content more interactively compared to 2D images
